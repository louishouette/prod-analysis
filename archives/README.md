# Truffle Production Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of truffle production data, examining factors such as:

- Production by parcel and species
- Productivity rates across different ages and species
- Average truffle weights
- Production per plant with age correlation
- Visualization of productivity heatmaps by parcel and age

## Contents

- `analyze_truffles.py`: Main Python script for analysis and visualization
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook version of the analysis
- `export-bilan.csv`: Source data for truffle production
- Various `.png` files: Visualization outputs from the analysis

## Getting Started

To run the analysis:

```bash
python analyze_truffles.py
```

Dependencies include pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy.
